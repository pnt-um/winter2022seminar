            Khon Kaen Smart Living Lab (KKLL) is a digital health service platform in Thailand. It provides testbed,
            training, operation and service such as a smart dashboard for governments and smart health and smart living
            portal for citizens. The KKLL collaboration includes academic, government, and private sectors. We conduct a
            variety of digital health research and innovation projects, including MANEE (preventive healthcare service),
            Smart ICU, Ambulance Operating Center (AOC), Long Term Care Digital Innovation, Youth Meter, Heath Avatar,
            Health AI, and Mine Mind.
            Khon Kaen Smart City is divided into three sections: the medical hub, the transportation hub, and the MICE
            city. It includes the construction of an excellent medical service center and an accident-emergency center
            for the medical hub. KKLL works with a variety of partners to develop digital health solutions for Khon Kaen
            Smart City.
            The KKLL's future plans include: 1) building a Smart City Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) and data
            platform, X-Road, to exchange health data in a single standard platform; 2) making this initiative a
            government policy so that it can be applied to citizens; and 3) promoting the initiative so that people can
            have inexpensive health sensors and smart technologies to monitor and anticipate health conditions in the
            long run.

            The connection between patients, medical staff, and medical etablishments plays a very important role in
            modern healthcare. This is an issue with many difficulties and challenges related to diverse aspects of
            legislation, healthcare policy, information security, infrastructure and technology platforms, technology
            ecosystems, community culture.
            In this technical report, we present a model to partially solve the problem: connecting three groups of
            patients - medical staff - medical facilities by building a healthcare social network, the GlobeDr
            healthcare network . We have developed and applied the healthcare network for a few medical etablishments in
            Ho Chi Minh City and supported health counsulting for people in many provinces and cities across the
            country.

            Massive numbers of new biomedical literature with databases are published each year, which is a precious
            knowledge resource but has yet been exploited to its full potential. The bioinformatics group at the Center
            for Bioscience and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-H­­­­CMC applies bioinformatics approaches to
            exploit the enormous invaluable data from natural language to genomics and proteomics. Among them, antibody
            and antigen are indispensable roles on targeted diagnosis, therapy, and biomedical discovery. For the first
            example, we present the development of a biomedical natural language processing tool that can automatically
            identify antibody and antigen entities from articles. We annotated an antibody-antigen corpus, including
            3210 relevant PubMed abstracts using a semi-automatic approach. We developed and optimized BiLSTM-CRF-based
            and BioBERT-based models, which served as the foundation for the development of a named entity recognition
            (NER) tool that automatically recognizes antibody and antigen names from biomedical literature. Our
            antibody-antigen NER models enable users to automatically extract antibody and antigen names from scientific
            articles without manually scanning through vast amounts of data and information in the literature. The
            output of NER can be used to automatically populate antibody-antigen databases, support antibody validation,
            and facilitate researchers with the most appropriate antibodies of interest. For the second example, we
            share the way to exploit the database about single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) to identify
            characteristics contributing to the function of nanobody, focusing on the complementarity-determining
            regions (CDRs), CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. We particularly analyzed amino acid groups, the occurrence frequency
            of each kind of amino acid, and repeat patterns. These results provide a simple set of rules to make it
            easier to generate desired candidates by computational means; also, they can be used as a reference to
            evaluate synthetic nanobodies. In summary, understanding the biomedical literature and bio-database to
            extract the information would be necessary direction support studies in the wet lab.

            We solve the general storage problem, in which there are n files that are stored on m servers such that even
            if there are up to r inactive servers, it can retrive any at most k distinct files by taking at most t from
            each remaining active servers.
            In literature, this decentralized storage problem was solved by other authors in the specific case t = 1,
            using combinatorial batch codes - CBC. Motivated by the application of Hall’s theorem, we consider the
            generalization version of the Hall Theorem and apply to solve the above general problem using erasure
            combinatorial batch codes-ECBC. In this work, we consider two reality cases in which we applied our solution
            for IoT and thesis storage.
