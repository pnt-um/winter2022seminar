    <h2>The Winter Seminar of Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine </h2>
    <h2>Subjects of Medical Technology - Dec 1, 2022</h2>

    <p>
        Science and Technology Conference is an important annual activity of Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine,
        in order to share knowledge and update scientific information in the field of medicine and training.
        The 15th Conference, 2022 is even more special to celebrate “Pham Ngoc Thach Week 2022”
        and the 33rd anniversary of the establishment of Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine (1989 – 2022).
        Within the framework of the Conference,
        the topic Nursing – Medical Technology (KTYH) was held in the morning session on
        May 6, 2022 at Lecture Hall 408, 4th floor, zone A2, Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine.


    </p>
    <p>
        The Nursing – Medical Technology symposium took place successfully, which is a testament to the efforts in
        developing scientific research activities and constantly updating and improving the professional knowledge
        of the lecturers in particular and the Faculty of Nursing – Medical Technology in general. Hope that the 15th
        Scientific Symposium on Nursing – Medical Science, 2022 brought a lot of useful sharing and
        information to delegates, teachers and students.
